# Potential Buffer Overflow in x86 Assembly

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in x86 assembly code. The vulnerability arises from the instruction `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]`, which accesses memory at an address calculated from `ebx`, `ecx`, and a scaling factor of 4.  If `ecx` is not properly validated, it can lead to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer, resulting in a crash or arbitrary code execution.

The `bug.asm` file contains the vulnerable code. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version with bounds checking to mitigate the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability:**
The core issue is the lack of bounds checking on `ecx`. If `ecx` is large enough to exceed the array bounds, it will lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mitigation:**
The solution involves adding code to validate the value of `ecx` before accessing memory. This could involve checking against the size of the array or another known boundary.

This example showcases the importance of careful memory management and bounds checking in low-level programming.
